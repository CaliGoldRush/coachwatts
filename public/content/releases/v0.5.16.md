## 🔗 New Integrations & Data Power-Ups

### Oura Ring Integration is Here! 🌙

Connect your Oura Ring to Coach Watts to bring sleep, readiness, and recovery data directly into your performance analysis. This gives the AI and your coach a complete picture of your total training load and recovery status.

### Next-Level Training Intelligence 🧠

We've significantly upgraded the depth of our analysis:

- **Optimal Cadence Calculation:** Coach Watts now calculates your optimal cycling cadence based on anthropometric factors (your body measurements). Get more precise targets for efficiency!
- **Enhanced Training Load (CTL/ATL):** We've improved how training load is calculated and recorded, ensuring the charts and summary metrics (like your weekly intensity) are consistent and highly accurate.
- **Smarter Workout Adherence:** The AI is now better than ever at analyzing your completed workouts. It uses highly detailed structured plan steps to give you precise feedback on where you nailed the effort and where you missed the targets.

- **Consistent Chart Tooltips:** All performance charts now feature standardized, immediate feedback tooltips for better data comprehension.
- **Fitbit Reliability:** We’ve made the Fitbit integration more robust, especially when dealing with rate limits, ensuring your data syncs reliably.
