# 🎉 Coach Watts v0.5.3: Sync Your Plan & Track Your Form!

Hey Coach Watts Community!

We're thrilled to launch v0.5.3, focused entirely on streamlining your workflow and giving you better insights into your fitness. This update includes a major integration many of you have been waiting for!

Here are the highlights of what’s new:

---

## 🚀 Seamless Intervals.icu Integration

For athletes and coaches who rely on Intervals.icu for tracking and analysis, your workflow just became *much* easier!

*   **One-Click Publishing:** You can now publish your planned workouts from Coach Watts directly onto your Intervals.icu calendar with a single button press on the plan dashboard. No more manual exports or data entry!
*   **Optimized Format:** We handle all the technical conversions to ensure your structured workouts display perfectly inside Intervals.icu.

## 📈 Enhanced Performance Metrics

Get a clearer picture of your physical status right inside your athlete profile.

*   **Training Load & Form:** Your Athlete Profile now features essential training metrics (often referred to as CTL/ATL/TSB) that show your current **Training Load** (Fitness) and **Form** (Freshness/Fatigue). Use these visual cues to train smarter, not just harder!

## 📢 Stay Up-to-Date

We want to make sure you never miss out on new features or critical updates.

*   **New Release Notifications:** We’ve added a prominent notification system to the dashboard header. When we release a new version, you’ll see the latest notes immediately, so you always know what improvements we’ve rolled out!
