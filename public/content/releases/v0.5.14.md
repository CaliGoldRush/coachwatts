We've shipped a major update focusing on perfecting our data foundation, enhancing the AI experience, and polishing the user interface on all devices.

Here are the highlights of what's new in v0.5.14:

---

## 🧠 AI Coach & Chat Upgrades

Your AI coach is now faster, smarter, and safer than ever!

- **User Confirmation for Tools 🛡️:** For sensitive actions like deleting a planned workout, the AI will now ask you for explicit confirmation in the chat before executing the command. Peace of mind guaranteed!
- **Faster and Visual Chat:** We’ve switched to a new chat architecture that enables streaming and complex, multi-step tool use.
  - **Chart Visualizations in Chat:** Charts generated by the AI now render immediately within the chat window, giving you instant feedback on new plans or analysis.
- **Smarter Agent Behavior:** Behind the scenes, we've updated the AI agent's system prompt and tool definitions, allowing it to perform more sophisticated analysis and decision-making when generating your plans and summaries.

## 📅 Calendar & Activity Experience

We've made daily navigation smoother and fixed critical issues with date handling.

- **Automatic Calendar Scroll:** The calendar now automatically scrolls to the current week when you load the Activities page, saving you a tap.
- **Desktop Calendar Fixes:** We've fine-tuned the calendar scrolling on desktop to ensure headers remain visible and scrolling is reliable.
- **Timezone Consistency Achieved 🌎:** We completed a massive system-wide overhaul of how we handle dates and timezones. All your activities, planned workouts, and wellness entries will now display with perfect accuracy, regardless of your location. No more mysterious date shifts!
- **Wellness Days Visible:** Days that only contain wellness entries (like sleep or weight) are now properly included in the calendar view.

## 📊 Data Quality & Integrations

We’re giving you more control over your data and improving sync reliability.

- **Activity Deduplication Tools:** Introducing new tools to identify and manage duplicate activities that might be synced from different sources (e.g., Strava and Garmin). This ensures your fitness reports are based on a single, clean source of truth.
- **Improved Intervals.icu Sync:**
  - **Zone Sync:** Intervals.icu zone settings (Power, HR) are now accurately synchronized and used in your analysis.
  - **Gym Workout Support:** Structured Gym workouts are now properly parsed, synced, and displayed.
  - **Better Pairing:** Completed workouts are now more robustly linked to their corresponding planned workouts via Intervals.icu data.

## 🎨 Design & Polish

We've standardized the visuals to make data easier to understand, especially on mobile.

- **Clearer Workout Charts:** We've refined and standardized the zone colors across all workout charts and components, making your intensity data easier to read at a glance.
- **Mobile Optimizations 📱:** We significantly improved the layout of workout details and the navigation bar to provide a much cleaner, more responsive experience on mobile devices.
- **Enhanced Power Profiles:** Planned workouts now feature improved visualization of their power profiles, helping you understand the structure of your upcoming session quickly.
