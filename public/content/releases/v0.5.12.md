### 🧠 Smarter Training Plans & Customization

This release turbocharges our AI planning engine, giving you unprecedented control over your training narrative:

- **Custom Plan Instructions ✍️:** When generating a new training plan, you can now provide specific, custom instructions to the AI. Tell it your preferences (e.g., "Avoid running on weekends," or "Focus heavily on time-crunched interval work") and the plan will be generated around your unique needs.
- **Live Plan Generation Status 🚀:** No more waiting or refreshing! The plan dashboard now shows you the real-time status as your training blocks are being generated.
- **Better Coach Notes:** Coaches can now easily include notes or context within the training plan dashboard, improving communication and plan alignment.
- **Improved Generation Logic:** We’ve fine-tuned the algorithms to ensure your training blocks align even better with your overall goals and periodization.

### 🧘 Daily Check-in Feature

We're introducing a quick new way to log how you feel:

- **Daily Check-in Modal ✅:** Quickly log your fatigue, readiness, and other key metrics directly in the app. Providing this consistent feedback ensures your training recommendations stay personalized and highly relevant.

### ✨ Enhanced User Experience & Clarity

We focused on improving stability, data visibility, and overall clarity:

- **Interactive Glossary Tooltips 💡:** See a technical term in your recommendations or scores that you don't recognize? Simply hover over it! We've added glossary tooltips to give you instant definitions and clarity on complex training concepts.
- **Safety Confirmations:** We’ve added confirmation modals before you execute important or destructive actions (like deleting a training plan) to prevent accidental changes.
- **Better Integration Visibility:** We've updated the workout page and attribution components with improved logos and rules, specifically enhancing the display of data coming from **Zwift** and **Apple Watch**.
- **Data Analysis Tools:** We've introduced powerful new tools and components to better analyze and visualize your long-term training data streams.

### 🛠 Stability & Performance

Behind the scenes, we’ve performed major structural cleanups (refactoring to use the Repository pattern) and resolved various typing and linting issues. This means a more stable, faster platform and allows us to build powerful new features even quicker in the future!

Enjoy the update, and happy cycling! 🚴‍♀️💨
